## Summary

With the introduction of the Account Aggregator, it’s time to level up the financial applications. In this new era of modern technology, customers deserve a **more intuitive and engaging digital banking experience**. Our aim is to introduce that experience! 
We have developed a **new generation of mobile banking app** which is more of a Financial Service Platform than a transaction only platform! **It's rich in user experience, targeted and hyper-personalized for every customer.**

Above this we have provided a **seamless on-boarding process involving less than a couple of clicks** for the users.

AA has for sure brought a heavy amount of data into the banking game. Everybody will have the data, but how you use it will matter the most. We used AA data to **create analysis models** based on different algorithms. This analysis process helped us:

  1. with **micro segmentation of customers**
     - Dividing customers into different DNA types. Each DNA type reveals a specific customer behaviour.
     - Map new customers into one of the DNA type.
     - Run targeted programs personalized for the users based on their segmentation.
     - Design financial journeys for them
     - Get the most out of every customer!


  2. convert **data into intuitive insights**
     - Hyper-personalization for each user.
     - Every customer treated in distinctive manner
     - Every user’s screen is unique with financial features.
     - Treat customers with custom nudges intuitively.
     - For example, one user might be seeing a payment due reminder where as another user seeing an investment suggestion as a nudge.


  3. understand a **user’s spend behaviour**.
     - Suggest financial management specifically for each user.
     - For example, how one can better manage their money.
     - or how one can improve their credit score.
